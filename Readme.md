# Rust Tutorial

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's syntactically similar to C++ but guarantees memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

## Installation

To install Rust, you need to install `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer.

### On Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
On Windows
Download and run the rustup-init.exe from rustup.rs.

After installation, run the following command to ensure Rust is installed:

sh
Copy code
rustc --version
Hello, World!
Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program.

Create a new directory for your project:

sh
Copy code
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
Create a new file named main.rs and open it in your favorite text editor. Write the following code:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
Compile and run your program:

sh
Copy code
rustc main.rs
./main
Using Cargo
Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It simplifies managing dependencies and building your projects.

Creating a new project
Create a new project using Cargo:

sh
Copy code
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
This will create a new directory named my_project with the following structure:

css
Copy code
my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
Open src/main.rs and you'll see the following code:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
Build and run your project:

sh
Copy code
cargo run
Variables and Mutability
In Rust, variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, you use the mut keyword.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6; // This line will cause a compile-time error

    let mut y = 5;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    y = 6; // This is fine because y is mutable
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
Data Types
Rust has several built-in data types, including scalar and compound types.

Scalar Types
Integer
Floating-point
Boolean
Character
Compound Types
Tuples
Arrays
rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    // Integer
    let x: i32 = 42;

    // Floating-point
    let y: f64 = 3.14;

    // Boolean
    let is_rust_great: bool = true;

# Rust Tutorial

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's syntactically similar to C++ but guarantees memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

## Installation

To install Rust, you need to install `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer.

### On Unix-like OS (Linux, macOS)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
On Windows
Download and run the rustup-init.exe from rustup.rs.

After installation, run the following command to ensure Rust is installed:

sh
Copy code
rustc --version
Hello, World!
Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program.

Create a new file called main.rs:

sh
Copy code
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
touch main.rs
Add the following code to main.rs:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
Compile and run the program:

sh
Copy code
rustc main.rs
./main
You should see the output Hello, world!.

Cargo
Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It simplifies managing Rust projects.

Creating a new project
Create a new project using Cargo:

sh
Copy code
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo
This creates a directory with the following structure:

text
Copy code
hello_cargo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
The Cargo.toml file is the manifest file for Rust. The src/main.rs file is the entry point for your application.

Open src/main.rs and you will see:

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
Build and run your project using Cargo:

sh
Copy code
cargo build
cargo run
You should see the output Hello, world!.

Adding dependencies
To add dependencies, modify the Cargo.toml file.

For example, to add the rand crate for random number generation:

Add the following to Cargo.toml:

toml
Copy code
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
Update the code in src/main.rs to use the rand crate:

rust
Copy code
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let n: u32 = rng.gen_range(0..10);
    println!("Random number: {}", n);
}
Build and run the project:

sh
Copy code
cargo build
cargo run
You should see a random number between 0 and 9.

Common Concepts
Variables and Mutability
By default, variables in Rust are immutable. To make a variable mutable, use the mut keyword.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("x = {}", x);

    let mut y = 5;
    println!("y = {}", y);
    y = 6;
    println!("y = {}", y);
}
Data Types
Rust has several basic data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let y: f64 = 3.14;
    let z: bool = true;
    let w: char = 'R';

    println!("x = {}, y = {}, z = {}, w = {}", x, y, z, w);
}
Functions
Functions are defined using the fn keyword.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    println!("Sum: {}", add(5, 3));
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
Control Flow
Rust supports if, else, else if, and match for control flow.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }

    match number {
        1 => println!("one"),
        2 => println!("two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("other"),
    }
}
Ownership and Borrowing
Rust’s central feature is ownership. Ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety.

rust
Copy code
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    // println!("{}", s1); // This will cause a compile error

    let s3 = String::from("hello");
    let s4 = &s3;
    println!("{}", s3);
    println!("{}", s4);
}
Conclusion
This tutorial covers the basics of Rust, including installation, creating a project, adding dependencies, and fundamental concepts like variables, data types, functions, control flow, and ownership. For more advanced topics, refer to the official Rust documentation.
